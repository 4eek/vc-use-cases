    <p>
      A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an <a href="#dfn-entity" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a claim describes a quality or qualities, property or properties of an entity which establish its existence and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and high-stakes <a href="#dfn-claim" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.

      </h3>

      <p>Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of claims as part of their everyday activities. As more and more of these important activities move to the Internet, entities need to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their location, accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records to payment account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize entities to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties. Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications, account access, collaboration, and professional development will depend on filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It is essential that data be verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>Standardization of digital <a href="#dfn-claim" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> technologies makes it possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these essential records about their counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This document presents an aggregate use case model, comprised of Needs, Roles, Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the use cases that the Verifiable Claims Working Group will address.</p>

      <p>User needs define the problem space Verifiable Claims addresses. User Roles specify the roles different entities play when interacting with Verifiable Claims. Tasks define the functions users can accomplish and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized by interactions between entities over time.</p>
      <p>As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The listed uses cannot exhaustively capture all possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model provides specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.</p>

        <dd>Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland. As part of that process, the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of possible sources to confirm her identity - a so called "Know Your Customer" check. She selects government-supplied
          <a href="#dfn-claim" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable claims</a> that confirm she receives postal mail at a certain address and that she has a national ID card. Confirming these allows the bank to open her account and be confident in her identity when she conducts transactions.

        <dd>Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a digitally signed <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank. This credential verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank and has access to her associated checking account. Since MidBank (and all banks in Finland) are required to perform "Know Your Customer" checks on accounts, this credential can also be used as sufficient verification by other financial institutions. This can help Jane assure destination banks that she is verified, thereby allaying concerns about misdirected transactions and money laundering.</dd>

        <dd>Tracy has a sore throat soon after moving to a new town. She finds a physician through her health care network and goes in for treatment. She is a new patient, so the clinic needs to know who she is and how she will be paying. When checking in, she presents her verifiable claim that demonstrates her identity and her proof of insurance. When the clinc submits this to the insurance company, they can automatically ascertain that she submitted her proof of identity and insurance to the provider and granted the physician the ability to submit the claim for payment.</dd>

At the clinic he is asked for proof of identity. He provides a credential that verifies his name and address, but elects not to disclose his marital status nor his social security number, as those are neither requested nor required at this clinic. He further marks the disclosure as expiring in 30 days - he does not want his information verifiable after that time.</dd>

Fortunately, Anoushka had been issued a self-soverign proof of birth, attached to which is the proof of birth and marriage for her parents. She is able to retrieve this because it is available from many places on the Internet.

      <p>In this example, a <a href="#dfn-holder" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> of a claim needs to use that claim in a typical commerce situation:</p>

      <ol title="Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
        <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
        <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
        <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a href="#dfn-credential-repository" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential repository</a> for the proof.
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="#dfn-credential-repository" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential repository</a> shows Jane three Verifiable Claims it knows of that can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving license, and birth certificate).</li>
        <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be shared with the merchant.</li>
        <li>The <a href="#dfn-credential-repository" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential repository</a> returns the selected claim as a response to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers it to the merchant.</li>
        <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid and satisfies the requirement.</li>
        <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site with appropriate authorization.</li>
